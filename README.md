Hello and welcome to my GitHub!

This project was created as a final year thesis project for the partial fulfilment of the Bachelor of Science Honours degree at Queen's University. The project aims to calculate the gravitational potential of N-body systems using the method of multipole expansion outlined in Binney and Tremaine 1987.

In this repository you will find my complete thesis paper suitably labeled, source code for calculating the gravitational potential MEX.py, the cosmological halo used for the analysis in my paper as well as an exmaple of running my code MEX.py as a module to calcuate the gravitational potential and forces for the cosmological halo given here. 

This project entailed writing code to compute the multipole expansion potential, developing analytic models to compare the accuracy of the code, displaying the results of the code visually with changing paramters, and performing data analysis to come up with future improvements and suggestions. 

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me at s.thomas@queensu.ca
